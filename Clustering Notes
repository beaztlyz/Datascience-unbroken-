    Points  
    K is number of clusters
    k = 3 / 3 clusters 
    randomly select three data points same as k
    
    step 3
    measure the distance between first point and the three intitial clusters 
    step 4 
    
    step 5
    calculate the mean of each cluster
    
    sum the variation
